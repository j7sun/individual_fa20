    "To explore this research question, we need to find out what the \"County residents are seeking in future park and recreation services by examining broader park trends and County demographics\".(1) This research is important because it aims to improve satisfaction toward parks & recreation among county residents. Also, it is an important research question that contributes to better funding distribution toward parks & recreation in San Diego. For example, it has been known that \"there is projected to be fewer residents ages 0-69 and more residents ages 70 and older by 2040\"(1). Therefore, the demand for more fitness programs, such as aerobic classes, would increase significantly. This suggests that parks & recreation areas should focus more on providing amenities and services for older generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides age, other demographic factors should also be considered as part of the trend analysis in order to improve long-term park planning. According to research, \"People who live in communities of concern rely on the physical, social, and economic benefits of public parks and programming but often have less access to recreational opportunities. Communities of concern are neighborhoods that have historically experienced lower levels of public and private investment in development and supporting infrastructure\"(2). Therefore, future planning needs to prioritize fundings in communities of concern in order to ensure equal access to parks & recreation.\n",

    "I hypothesize that analyzing sociodemographic trends in San Diego County could offer insightful suggestions on long-term park & recreation planning. Specifically, I expect to demonstrate how performing trend analysis on demographic factors such as age, ethnicity, and gender could recommend modifying existing amenities & services being provided at Parks and Recreation. Furthermore, I expect to see a more balanced funding distribution on Parks and Recreation by researching access to these areas based on household income and community location. In summary, I believe that performing analysis of sociodemographic trends is the key step for park & recreation development because it implies relevant recreation trends from various sources that may influence San Diego County's recreation planning.\n"

Lastly, another bias that could potentially exist in the project is the 50 Amenities & Services being selected from all the choices that are available at San Diego County's Parks and Recreation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before constructing my data frame, I plan to remove any personal identifications that are associated with household income. Moreover, in order to eliminate the bias brought by the income range, I decided to add more observations and set an equal income range. Also, using the collection of average income is not reliable and we cannot ignore the existence of outliers. Therefore, in response, I would consider collecting the median of household income instead of average income. In order to mitigate this bias, I would select 500 Amenities & Services in total and pick 50 of them after randomization. "
